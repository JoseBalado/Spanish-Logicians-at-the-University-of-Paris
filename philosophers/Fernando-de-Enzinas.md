Fernando de Enzinas is an extraordinary representative of the type of logic that was fashionable in Paris, Alcalá, and Salamanca. It is known that he is from Valladolid because he describes himself as such in several preambles of his works.

He pursued his early studies at the Complutense University, having been a disciple of Saint Thomas of Villanova around 1513, and a companion of Domingo de Soto.

Around the year 1518, he moved to Paris, where he completed his studies and taught Arts at the colleges of Santa Bárbara and Beauvais, as indicated by the colophon of his printed works.

In the academic year 1522-1523, he reappeared in Alcalá as a regent of Summulae, dying prematurely in August 1523, as we find in the Complutense books: "September 7, 1523. They provided the chair of Summulae due to the death of Master Enzinas to Master Almenara."

Alvar Gómez observes that in his youth, the Summulae of Enzinas were read in Alcalá, and the visits to the chairs confirm the same fact. Even in 1534, it is said that the "chair of Summulae reads from Significatione Terminorum by Enzinas," and the companion of the same chair read that same year "the second part of the Terms of Enzinas," and the regent of logic, according to the same visit, "now reads Syllogisms by Enzinas."[^1]

In Salamanca, around 1530, we have testimony that Cristóbal de Medina read Summulae by Enzinas, whom he considered the best treatise writer of all, and whom he printed in Salamanca to assist in his lessons. In a work of his titled, Introductio Dialecticae, says, in a prologue to the students of Salamanca: "cum statuissem me hoc primo nostri cursus anno, optimi adolescentes... tractatum Summularum Ferdinandi de Enzinas ad unguem vobis propalare..." f. 2. And the same Cristóbal de Medina, in the Salamanca edition of Primus Tractatus Summularum de Enzinas, brings this praise of the master from Valladolid: "Haec ergo me etiam ratio ad praesens adduxit ut primum tractatum magistri Ferdinandi a Enzinas curarim, quia scilicet vir fuerit in omni re dialectica unice doctus et multa, ad hanc artem facientia, ingeniose admodum sic erudite elucubravit... Nam cum ante hoc Johannes Maioris, Dullaert, Celayas et alios quosdam solitus sim interpretari..." f. 1.
