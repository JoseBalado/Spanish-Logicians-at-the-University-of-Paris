**Gaspar Lax** was an Aragonese philosopher and logician. He was born in Sariñena (Huesca) in 1487, the son of Leonor de la Cueva and Gaspar Lax, a physician, and had two brothers and four sisters[^1].

After a brief stay at the Estudio de Artes in Zaragoza, he went to Paris at the age of 17.

### Period in Paris
By 1507-1508, he was already teaching at the Collège de Calvi, known as the "little Sorbonne," and later moved to the Collège de Montaigu, where he alternated teaching with his own education under John Major[^2]. In Paris, he was known as the "Prince of Sophists," and his works and lessons were highly praised[^3]. He remained at Montaigu until 1516, leaving a lasting impression on his students, including Juan de Celaya, Juan Dolz del Castellar, Francisco Vitoria, and Luis Vives.

### Return to Spain
In 1516, Lax returned to Spain, possibly due to a decree expelling foreigners from the University of Paris[^4]. He settled at the Estudio Mayor de Artes in Zaragoza, where he taught logic and mathematics. He was appointed Vice-Chancellor and Master, equivalent to Rector. His death in 1560 was followed with great interest by the members of the University, and he was buried in the Church of San Nicolás de Bari[^6].

At the University of Alcalá, some of Lax's works were studied. For example, the "Tractatus terminorum una cum prima parte Summularum" (Paris, 1512) was reprinted by the University itself (1512) and recommended to students by the professor of logic, Tomás García de Villanueva. In the dedication, Lax is called "nostrae Hispaniae decus" (pride of our Spain)[^7].

He continued in Zaragoza with great recognition in the academic world. In 1559, he suffered from blindness and gout problems, and finally passed away on February 23, 1560, after having developed a prestigious career in France and Spain[^8].
