**Jerónimo Pardo** was a notable Spanish logician and theologian. He was born in the province of Burgos[^1] and is known to have arrived in Paris at the end of the fifteenth century. He studied and taught at the College of Montaigu and was possibly Mair's teacher[^2]. Pardo was a fellow of the Sorbonne but never became a Doctor of Theology. He taught theology in Melun until his death, which occurred in 1502 according to Muñoz Delgado and Villoslada, or 1505 according to Elie and Fraile[^3].

Pardo wrote a manual on logic and one on natural philosophy, which he never completed. García Villoslada considers that the latter is in fact the *Introductiones phisicales artium Hieronimo Pardo ad totam naturalem philosophiam*, the manuscript of which is preserved in the Columbine Library of Seville (n. 3351)[^4].

The only work published by Pardo was *Medulla Dyalectices*. The first edition was published by Pardo in Paris in 1500, with a foreword by his brother Miguel. The work was republished in Paris by John Mair and Jacobo Ortiz in 1505, after Jerónimo's death.

*Note: The content of this article up to this point, with very few changes, was taken from* Paloma Pérez-Ilzarbe (1996). *The Doctrine of Descent in Jeronimo Pardo. Meaning, Inference, Truth.*

Includes an index and corrections made by Ortiz as stated in the foreword, reproduced here:

> Medulla Dialectices edita a perspicacissimo artium praeceptor Hieronymo Pardo. Ferme graviores difficultates logicas acutissimae dissolvens, omnibus dialectice studiosis plurimum accommoda, de novo correcta et emendata cum tabula notabilium et propositionum disputatarum iuxta materiam et ordinem foliorum et capitulorum, per honorandos magistros: magistrum Iohannem Maioris in Sacra Theologia baccalarium, necnon per acutissimi ingenii virum magistrum Iacobum Ortiz, quia postremo ipsam cum augmento castigavit eique tabulam supradictam apposuit.

This is the index of the Medulla Dyalectices:
- Capitulum primum: De veritate et falsitate
- Capitulum secundum: De consequentiis
- Capitulum tertium: De contradictoriis
- Capitulum quartum: De conversionibus
- Capitulum quintum: De hypotheticis
- Capitulum sextum: De ampliationibus
- Capitulum septimum: De appellatione primo de formali
- Capitulum octavum: De modalibus
- Capitulum nonum: De syllogismis de medio communi
- Capitulum decimum: De descensu
